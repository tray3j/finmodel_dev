## Current design Philosophy
In a very general and abstract sense, financial modeling seeks to correctly predict changes in an organization's accounting statements (output) given certain changes in the business (input).

A good model defines the relationship between those inputs and outputs reliably and efficiently. 

When *actual* business activity occurs, we record that as *actuals*. For that, no model is needed, just reporting according to the applicable accounting standards. We need a model to understand what could happen in the future, or if another set of business events had happened in the past. 

The set of future or predicted inputs to a model are *assumptions*, as they are what we assume may happen in some other version of reality. 

The last flavor of data relevant to modeling are *metrics*. These are Usually ratios of different actuals, such as revenue per sales rep or days of sales outstanding.
