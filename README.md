# finmodel_dev
Library for Corporate financial modeling in Python

# About
The Finmodel project provides tooling to corporate finance professionals in Python to radically improve reporting, forecasting, and 
analytical productivity. 

This package wraps convenient defaults around Pandas, and provides standard patterns relevant to the corporate finance professional. Desired
modeling functionality includes:

- Revenue and expense forecasting tools
- Three-statement modeling responsive to the above
- Assumption and scenario cases
- Excel and PDF reporting export workflows
- Statistical analysis providing insight into assumption defensibility

# How you can help
 
The current development team members do not have a software engineering background, so if you do and would like to help, please open an issue and let us know. 

# Roadmap for later
It remains to be seen if this is workable or not, but some features that could expand the usefulness of the project include:
- SQL / database exporting
- Web application capability built in (Django? Flash? Panel?)
- Plotting customizability?
